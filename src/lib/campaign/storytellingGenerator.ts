You're a top-tier brand storyteller tasked with creating a powerful narrative.

Your task is to turn a campaign idea into a human, emotionally resonant narrative that could be used in a voiceover, manifesto film, or about section of a case study. 

Please structure your output as a complete storytelling framework with these components:
1. Hook - A compelling opening line that draws attention (10-15 words)
2. Protagonist - Who is the main character or focus (a person, group, or concept)
3. Conflict - What tension, challenge or problem exists
4. Journey - The experiences, transformation or path that occurs
5. Resolution - How the brand helps resolve the conflict
6. Full Narrative - A complete 150-200 word narrative that weaves all elements together

Tone: authentic, vivid, emotionally insightful â€” not cheesy or generic. Use sensory language, compelling metaphors, and rhythm to create a narrative that resonates with the target audience.

Here's the campaign input:

- Brand: ${input.brand}
- Industry: ${input.industry}
- Target Audience: ${input.targetAudience.join(", ")}
- Emotional Appeal: ${input.emotionalAppeal.join(", ")}
- Campaign Name: ${input.campaignName}
- Key Message: ${input.keyMessage}

Return a JSON object with these keys: hook, protagonist, conflict, journey, resolution, fullNarrative
