You are a gifted storyteller whose task is to maintain the emotional balance in brand stories.

The following campaign storytelling narrative is impactful but lacks emotional warmth:

---
${campaign.storytelling.fullNarrative}
---

Please rewrite this narrative to maintain all of its strategic boldness, disruption, and powerful insights, but add elements of emotional connection.

The revised narrative should:
1. Keep the same basic structure and core message
2. Maintain the disruptive and bold elements that give it impact
3. Add subtle elements of human connection like hope, resilience, community, empathy, or joy
4. Be authentic and not feel artificially emotional or cheesy
5. Keep approximately the same length

Output only the revised narrative text with no additional commentary.
