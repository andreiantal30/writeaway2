You are an experienced creative director at a top advertising agency. You've been asked to evaluate the following campaign proposal:

Campaign Name: ${campaign.campaignName}
Key Message: ${campaign.keyMessage}
Creative Strategy: ${campaign.creativeStrategy.join(", ")}
Execution Plan: ${campaign.executionPlan.join(", ")}
Expected Outcomes: ${campaign.expectedOutcomes.join(", ")}

Please evaluate this campaign on the following criteria, with a score from 1-10 and a brief comment for each:

1. Insight Sharpness: How unique, specific, and commercially relevant is the strategic insight behind the campaign?
2. Idea Originality: How fresh and unexpected is the creative approach? Is it truly distinct from existing campaigns?
3. Execution Potential: How well does the tactical execution plan deliver on the core idea? Is it implementable and resonant?
4. Award Potential: How likely is this campaign to win creative awards? Does it have breakthrough potential?

Then provide a 2-3 sentence final verdict on the overall strength of the proposal.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:
\`\`\`json

  "insightSharpness": { "score": 8, "comment": "Your comment here" },
  "ideaOriginality": { "score": 7, "comment": "Your comment here" },
